        <h4 class="fst-italic">About</h4>
        <p class="mb-4">We want to give our fellow fetishists the opportunity to dress in their best outfits and dance the night away to electronic music. The goal is to create the club and the parties weâ€™ve been missing ourselves. A big part of our motivation is to contribute to the development of the Swedish fetish scene, in cooperation with serious and well established actors.</p>
        <h1 class="fs-6">Dresscode</h1>
        <p class="mb-4">To gain entry to our parties you need to follow our strict dress code. Latex, vinyl or leather. These include datex, heavy rubber, patent leather, PVC, animal leather, PU-leather, vegan leather and leatherette.</p>
        <h1 class="fs-6">Socialize</h1>
        <p class="mb-0">KROPPSFABRIKEN is meant to be a venue for meeting old and new friends. The dress code and the music are essential parts, but the socialization is an equally important aspect. To be able to have a drink and converse with other fetishists, in a reasonable noise level, is something we value.</p>
